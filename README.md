# Artitrack-app
Artist retrieval app using the Spotify REST API client. Provides user with the functionality to inquire about their top artists/tracks, track features and analysis. 
For example, search top artists and tracks for the current month, last six months, or all time. 
You can also view your public playlists and sort tracks by danceability, tempo, or energy.

To view your top artists and tracks, click the "Top artists this month," "Top tracks this month," or "SEE ALL" links.

To view your public playlists, click the "Public Playlists" or "SEE ALL" links, or click on a playlist shown on the page.

In the playlist page, you can sort tracks by danceability, tempo, or energy. 
Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing, while tempo is the speed of a given piece. 
Energy represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.
